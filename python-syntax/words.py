# Do this work in a new file, words.py.

# For a list of words, print out each word on a separate line, but in all uppercase. 
# How can you change a word to uppercase? Ask Python for help on what you can do with strings!

# Turn that into a function, print_upper_words. Test it out. 
# (Don’t forget to add a docstring to your function!)

# Change that function so that it only prints words that start with the letter ‘e’ (either upper or lowercase).

# Make your function more general: you should be able to pass in a set of letters, 
# and it only prints words that start with one of those letters.

# For example:

# # this should print "HELLO", "HEY", "YO", and "YES"

            print(word.upper())

                   must_start_with={"h", "y"})
